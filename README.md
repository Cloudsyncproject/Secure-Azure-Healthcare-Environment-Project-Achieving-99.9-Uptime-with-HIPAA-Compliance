## Example: Mapping a Specific IaC File or Deployment Script

Suppose you have a Bicep or ARM template called `network.bicep` that defines your core network architecture (firewall, subnets, NSGs).

**Mapping Example:**

| Architecture Block     | IaC File          | Description                                                                          |
|-----------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Azure Firewall        | `network.bicep`   | Deploys Azure Firewall at the network perimeter.                                     |
| Web/App/DB Subnets    | `network.bicep`   | Defines DMZ, Application, and Database subnets, and assigns NSGs.                    |
| Network Security      | `network.bicep`   | Configures NSG rules for tier isolation (web, app, db), restricts management access. |
| Application Gateway   | `appgw.bicep`     | Deploys Azure Application Gateway with WAF enabled.                                  |
